* Using .Xresources

- urxvt :: Works out of the box
- Emacs :: Requires "xresources-theme" to work

- Adwaita theme :: Requires custom parsing (convert colors into SCSS variables)
- Openbox :: Requires custom parsing, can include entire configuration in .Xresources, then use that to generate actual ob config
- Tint2 :: Requires custom parsing, same as openconfig, make the entire config in xresources and convert it.
