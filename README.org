* System overview
I've included some notes on the overall system setup so I can remember what pieces I've used and if there are important things to consider.

- Distribution :: Arch Linux
- Display manager :: LightDM 
- Window manager :: Openbox 
  - Autostart uses some custom-made scripts
- Editor :: Emacs 
- Terminal :: rxvt-unicode 
- Theme :: oomox-skeletor (bespoke)
- Icons :: oomox-skeletor (bespoke)
- Panel :: Tint2
  Tint2 start menu relies on a custom-made desktop icon and an executable script, that uses ~xdotool~ to call Openbox menu via hotkey
- Notifications :: dunst
** System tray
- Audio :: volumeicon

* Things to do / figure out
** DONE Print screen 
** DONE Capslock to escape
- can change with ~setxkbmap~, but setting doesn't stick, need to put it in autostart
** DONE Start menu to Tint2 
- this apparently requires some guru tactics, like invoking keypresses with a terminal utility
** DONE Tint2 config to repo
** TODO Monitor setup
- [X] Make TV resolution stick to 1920x1080
- [ ] Make TV resolution stick to 1920x1080 in LightDM as well
** TODO Mount extra drives
- [X] Apps/Projects setup
- [ ] Documents setup
** TODO Dunst config
** TODO LightDM config
** TODO Emacs: flymake-eslint-enable
Something goes wrong with the hook and we have to manually enable this after eglot init
