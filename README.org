* System overview
I've included some notes on the overall system setup so I can remember what pieces I've used and if there are important things to consider.

- Distribution :: Arch Linux
- Display manager :: LightDM 
- Window manager :: Openbox 
  - Autostart uses some custom-made scripts
- Editor :: Emacs 
- Terminal :: rxvt-unicode
  Used plugins:
  - ~urxvt-tabbedex~
  - ~urxvt-resize-font~
- Theme :: Oomox with Base16, configurable with chezmoi
- Icons :: Suru++ Aspromauros, follows configured accent color
- Panel :: Tint2
  Tint2 start menu relies on a custom-made desktop icon and an executable script, that uses ~xdotool~ to call Openbox menu via hotkey
- Notifications :: dunst
- File manager :: PCManFm
- Archiver UI :: Xarchiver
- Compositor :: picom
  - xrender, only shadows and fades
** System tray
- Audio :: volumeicon
- Network :: NetworkManager

* TODO Tig config
- Tig uses terminal colors as it should, but color selection could be better (poor contrast with white and green)
