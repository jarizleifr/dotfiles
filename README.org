* System overview
I've included some notes on the overall system setup so I can remember what pieces I've used and if there are important things to consider.

- Distribution :: Arch Linux
- Display manager :: LightDM 
- Window manager :: Openbox 
  - Autostart uses some custom-made scripts
- Editor :: Emacs 
- Terminal :: rxvt-unicode
  Used plugins:
  - ~urxvt-tabbedex~
  - ~urxvt-resize-font~
- Theme :: oomox-skeletor (bespoke)
- Icons :: oomox-skeletor (bespoke)
- Panel :: Tint2
  Tint2 start menu relies on a custom-made desktop icon and an executable script, that uses ~xdotool~ to call Openbox menu via hotkey
- Notifications :: dunst
- File manager :: PCManFm
- Archiver UI :: Xarchiver
- Compositor :: picom
** System tray
- Audio :: volumeicon

* Things to do / figure out
** DONE Print screen 
** DONE Capslock to escape
- can change with ~setxkbmap~, but setting doesn't stick, need to put it in autostart
** DONE Start menu to Tint2 
- this apparently requires some guru tactics, like invoking keypresses with a terminal utility
** DONE Tint2 config to repo
** DONE Mount extra drives
- [X] Apps/Projects setup
- [X] Documents setup
** DONE Better shutdown menu
- Too many presses with exitting openbox and then shutting down from LightDM. Should be able to just shutdown the system from a power menu button on tint2.
** DONE Print screen folder
- [X] Put screencaps in ~/screenshots
** DONE Picom setup to repo
** TODO Monitor setup
- [X] Make TV resolution stick to 1920x1080
- [X] Fix refresh rate issue 
- [X] Scripts for monitor selection
- [ ] Make TV resolution stick to 1920x1080 in LightDM as well
  - This seemed to fix itself with nvidia settings, but I need to double check and figure out where this is actually set
  - I think one can set up a start script in LightDM
** TODO Dunst config
** TODO LightDM config
** TODO Emacs: flymake-eslint-enable
Something goes wrong with the hook and we have to manually enable this after eglot init
** TODO Emacs: Have a variable for programming modes
- Currently we need to specify modes for eglot, auto-formatting and company mode all separately. It works but could reduce repetition with a variable
** TODO Folder naming convention
** TODO Tig config
- Tig uses terminal colors as it should, but color selection could be better (poor contrast with white and green)
