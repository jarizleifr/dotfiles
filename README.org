* Jarizleifr's configuration
- Currently this setup is for Windows only, I might include alternative setups if I start using Linux more often.
- Documentation for specific configurations can be found in respective folders.
  - For example my Emacs config is quite elaborately documented
** Requirements
1. First install [[https://scoop.sh][Scoop]]
2. Using Scoop, install the following apps:
  - Git
  - Cmder
  - Emacs
  - Autohotkey
** Usage
- Once the initial requirements are met:
  - Clone this repository to a ~dotfiles~ folder in the user home folder
  - Run ~setup.cmd~, the script will:
    - Create symlinks for configurations
    - Add contents of ~startup~ to Windows Startup
